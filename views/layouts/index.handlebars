		1.Wireless sensor networks have wide range of application such as healthcare, environmental monitoring, industrial monitoring, etc. Sensing techniques should be smart
		such that it includes a continuous real-time monitoring and evaluation of sensor data
		for possible measurement faults.
	</p>	
	
	<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px">
		2.For continuous real-time monitoring of sensors a web-interface is developed to visualize the time-series data.
	</p>

	<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px">
		3.Failure of the system should be detected in real-time to take corrective action quickly.
	</p>

	<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px">
		4.Sensors used for continuous real-time sensing are not always reliable as sometimes faults are observed in the sensor measurements.
	</p>

	<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px">
		5.Leveraging correlation among multiple sensors, simple rule based model is developed to detect and correct faults in the sensor measurements.
	</p>

	<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px">
		6.Neural network and support vector machine based model for detecting faulty measurements, developed in this research,show better performance than correlation based technique.
